## CPP00
CPP00 is the introductory project in the C++ sequence at 42, focusing on fundamental concepts and constructs of C++ programming. This project emphasizes:

- **Namespaces:** Learning how to use namespaces to avoid name conflicts and organize code.
- **Classes and Instances:** Understanding how to define classes and create instances, managing visibility with private, protected, and public access specifiers.
- **Member Attributes and Functions:** Working with attributes and functions that belong to classes, and utilizing initialization lists for proper object setup.
- **Accessors and this Keyword:** Implementing accessor methods for data encapsulation and using the this pointer to refer to the current object instance.
- **stdio Streams:** Utilizing standard I/O streams for input and output operations.
- **Static and Const:** Exploring static members and constant data to manage class-level attributes and immutability.

## CPP01
CPP01 delves into more advanced features of C++ with a focus on memory management and data handling:

- **Memory Allocation:** Understanding dynamic memory allocation with new and deallocation with delete.
- **References and Pointers:** Learning about references, pointers, and pointers to members for efficient data manipulation.
- **File Streams:** Working with file streams to read from and write to files, enhancing file handling capabilities.

## CPP02
CPP02 introduces concepts related to polymorphism and class design, crucial for writing flexible and reusable C++ code:

- **Ad-hoc Polymorphism:** Implementing polymorphism through function overloading to allow multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
- **Operator Overloading:** Defining custom behavior for operators to work with user-defined types.
- **Orthodox Canonical Class Form:** Adhering to the canonical form of classes to ensure proper handling of copy construction, assignment, and destruction.

## CPP03
CPP03 focuses on inheritance, a core principle of object-oriented programming that allows for the creation of hierarchical class structures:

- **Inheritance:** Understanding how to derive new classes from existing ones, enabling code reuse and the extension of functionality.

## CPP04
CPP04 culminates in advanced object-oriented concepts and design principles:

- **Subtype Polymorphism:** Leveraging subtype polymorphism to allow objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
- **Virtual Destructors:** Implementing virtual destructors to ensure proper cleanup of derived class objects when deleted through base class pointers.
- **Abstract Classes:** define a common interface with pure virtual functions that must be implemented by derived classes, preventing direct instantiation and enabling polymorphism.
